This repo contains the source code of my project that I carried out during my academic experience at the University of Bologna.

The aim of the project is to conduct a comparative analysis on the evolution of mortality and life expectancy in Great Britain and France, considering historical data from 1922 to 2018.

The analysis was conducted with R and the `demography` package, using data provided by the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/), freely available after registration.

All the information about this project, the methods used for the analysis, the preliminary hypotheses and the results obtained, can be found on my personal website.
